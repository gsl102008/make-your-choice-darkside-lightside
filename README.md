## Introduction
This project is a basic implementation of an interactive storytelling game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players make choices at each step, influencing the direction of the story.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.

## Game Structure
The game is structured into segments, each representing a part of the story. The player makes choices at each segment, leading to different outcomes.

- **Introduction**: Sets the scene for the story.
- **Exploration**: The player decides whether to explore a cave or continue in the forest.
- **Cave Adventure**: The player encounters a treasure chest and decides whether to open it or leave the cave.

Feel free to expand the `storyData` array in the `script.js` file to add more segments and choices.

## Customization
- **Styling**: Customize the visual appearance of the game by modifying the styles in the `styles.css` file.
- **Storyline**: Expand and modify the `storyData` array in the `script.js` file to create a more complex and engaging narrative.
